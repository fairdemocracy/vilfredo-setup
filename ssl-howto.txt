How to create a SSL certificate for a different domain name
-----------------------------------------------------------
The following instructions are only valid if you choose to subscribe to a paying SSL certificate with a commercial authority.
Please note free and fully working SSL certificates can be as well obtained through Let's Encrypt.

Enter

scripts/createcert [domain name]

and enter all required data.

A CSR file (Certificate Signing Request) will be produced. This has to be uploaded to a certificate authority.
A confirmation email message will then be sent to the email address indicated in the CSR.
After confirming ownership of the domain, a CRT file will be generated. The intermediate certificates have now to be concatenated to its contents.
Finally, the CRT file must be uploaded to the /etc/ssl/certs folder on the server, and NGINX has to be restarted.
Do not forget to backup the KEY file in the /etc/ssl/private folder: it is required to use the certificate.
